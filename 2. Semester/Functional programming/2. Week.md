Assignment:
```Haskell
x := x + 1
```
Sequential composition:
`"do this";"then do that"`
conditional execution:
`if, then, else`
repetition:
`while, do, goto`


### No mutual state
Referential Transparency: WYSIWYG for programmers.
`f(x)` only depends on the definition of `f` and the value of the parameter `x`

### Functions are first-class citizens
