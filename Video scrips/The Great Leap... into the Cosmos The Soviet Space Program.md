July 20th, 1969. "That's one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind." With those words, the Space Race had its victor. An American flag stood on the lunar surface, and to many, it seemed the communist challenge had finally been vanquished.

Growing up in the West, this is the story I was told, the triumphant American narrative. But there was always another side to this story, written not in stars and stripes, but in hammer and sickle. This is the story of the other space race.

Decades before Apollo 11, the seeds of this conflict were being sown on opposite sides of the world. In 1926, in Auburn, Massachusetts, Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket, a fragile, pioneering device whose significance he could scarcely imagine.
During the 1920s the soviets sprung onto the rocket train, where the first test-firing of a solid fuel rocket was carried out in March 1928, which flew for about 1,300 meters. These applications quickly developed into military technology but saw battle only in the form of the RS-82 missiles which lead to the destruction of 16 Japanese fighters and bombers in 1939.

1942, german scientists, namely walter thiel, designed the Aggregat-A4, or better known as the V2, The A4 was a full-sized design with a range of about 320 kilometers and a payload of about 1,000 kg. Versions of the A4 included the first ballistic missile and the first projectile to reach outer space.

After the Allies stood victoriously over Berlin, a race for technology and trained personnel started. The US Operation Paperclip in which over 1600 of the best scientists and engineers were brought onto the American continent and the soviet Operation Osoaviakhim which could only reap the leftovers of the US Operation. Both were carried out in secret.

In the US, Werneher von Braun, a former member of the Nazi party and later the SS, rose with his work on the Aggregat A4 to the high position of director of the newly formed  Marshal space flight center and as the chief architect of the  Saturn 5 that propelled the "Apollo (spacecraft)") to the Moon. 

The Soviets, with Operation Osoaviakhim, could only grab the leftovers. They distrusted their German captives, keeping them isolated and forcing them to write theoretical papers before eventually sending them home and scrapping the German designs. It seemed the Soviets had already lost the technological race before it even truly began

In the fall of 1957, a new sound echoed from the heavens. It wasn't a divine signal; it was the steady beep of a 184-pound metal ball called Sputnik. Its message was clear: a nation that had, just a generation prior, been a backward agrarian empire and was still reeling from the loss of 27 million souls in World War II, had just leaped into the future. Sputnik 1 was the first human-made satellite in orbit, a marvel of engineering that kicked off the Space Race and enabled humanity to reach for the stars like never before.

The launch vehicle, a marvel in its own right, was a derivative of the R-7 Semyorka the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile. This multi-stage rocket, designed under the leadership of the brilliant Chief Designer Sergei Korolev, stood 31 meters tall and generated a liftoff thrust of nearly 4 meganewtons. Its four strap-on boosters would fire for exactly two minutes before the core stage took over, pushing the satellite into orbit.

The success of Sputnik was the culmination of years of secret Soviet research. This effort included pioneers like Aleksei Isaev, who had worked on the BI-1 rocket interceptor during World War II and later founded his own design bureau, KB Khimmash, focusing on precise liquid-fueled engines. While Isaev's work was critical for smaller rockets and spacecraft control, the colossal power for the R-7 came from the engines of Valentin Glushko.

The launch was unanticipated by the United States and triggered the "Sputnik Crisis." Earlier U-2 spy flights had suggested the US held a nuclear advantage, but Sputnik revealed a shocking Soviet lead in rocket technology. Combined with studies showing the USSR was training two to three times as many scientists per year as the US, this was interpreted as a grave threat to national security. The American panic directly spurred the creation of NASA, a massive federal investment in science education, and the rush to launch Explorer 1 on the Juno I rocket in 1958.
