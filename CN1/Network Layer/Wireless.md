Frequency is in Hz, Wireless Internet works in the 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz spectrum.

How many dBm are 4 Watts
$4W = 4000mW$
$10 * \log_{10}(4000) = 36dBm$

How many dBm are 8 Watts
$8W = 8000mW$
$10*\log_{10}(8000)=39dBm$

law of 3s
	A value of 3 dB means that the power value of interest is double the reference value
	A value of −3 dB means the power value of interest is half the reference
	Whenever a power level doubles, it increases by 3 dB
	Whenever it is cut in half, it decreases by 3 dB
		$4W$  to $8W = 36dBm$ to $39dBm$
Law of 10s
	A value of 10 dB means that the power value of interest is 10 times the reference value
	A value of −10 dB means the power value of interest is 1/10 of the reference

#### Hidden Node Problem
A situation in wireless networks where two transmitters cannot sense each other’s transmissions but both send data to the same receiver, causing collisions at the receiver.
