#### Single mode Fiber
- Very small core
- uses expensive lasers
- long distance
#### multimode fiber
- larger core
- uses LEDs
- up to 10Gbps over 550 meters

#### Chromatic dispersion
- Different wavelengths travel at different speeds
- Causes spreading of the light pulse
Chromatic dispersion is the phenomenon where **different wavelengths (colors) of light travel at different speeds** through an optical fiber, causing pulse spreading.
#### Polarized Mode Dispersion (PMD)
- Single-mode fiber supports two polarization states
- Fast and slow axes have different group velocities
- causes spread of light pulse
PMD is the phenomenon where **two orthogonal polarization modes** in a single-mode fiber travel at slightly different speeds, causing pulse spreading.
