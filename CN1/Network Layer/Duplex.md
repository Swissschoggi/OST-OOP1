#### Half-Duplex
This can be very easily summarized by the example of a walkie talkie, data can be sent and received but only one at a time.

#### Full-Duplex
Full-Duplex, like a phone line, where you can talk over each other, data is sent bidirectional as well just simultaneously. You can send and receive data at the same time.

If you look at a print of a Cisco link, you can see if the link reports collisions it is half-duplex.
