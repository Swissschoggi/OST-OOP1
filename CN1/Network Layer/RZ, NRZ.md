#### Return to Zero (RZ)
Return to Zero basically means that the signal returns to zero Voltage after every bit transmitted.
It has good self-clocking which means that a time can be established after every bit is sent.

#### Non Return to Zero (NRZ)
Non Return to Zero means that the signal stays at the voltage of the last bit sent. As there is no self-clocking or poor self-clocking long 1s or 0s could cause loss of information as the receiver wouldnt know when a new 0 or 1 is transmitted or how many.
